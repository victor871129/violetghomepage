<p><strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Mobile Device Identifiers, and Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.</p>
<p><em>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</em>. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</p>
<p><em>Mobile Device Identifiers</em>. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Google Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device. In some cases, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID.</p>
<p><em>Analytics</em>. We may also use Google Analytics to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
<p>Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>
<p><em>Operationally Necessary</em>. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</p>
<p><em>Performance Related</em>. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;</p>
<p><em>Functionality Related</em>. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;</p>
<p><em>Advertising or Targeting Related</em>. We may use first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party digital properties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Interest Based Advertising</strong></p>
<p>You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. To separately make choices for mobile apps on a mobile device, you can download the DAA&#8217;s AppChoices application from your device&#8217;s app store. In addition, for some devices you may use your device&#8217;s platform controls in your settings to exercise choice (e.g., <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">iOS</a>).</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>, <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/choices/">https://youradchoices.ca/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribing from Email and Electronic Communications</strong></p>
